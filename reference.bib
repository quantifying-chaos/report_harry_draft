	            shown to exhibit periodic and chaotic motion in the absence of
	            any external signal. We show how the genetic structure of a
	            population can initiate bifurcations to periodic and chaotic
	            trajectories. We investigate by simulation the dependence of this
	            phenomenon on the strength of assortative mating, the level of
	            heterozygosity, and the intensity of selection. The implications
	            of internally generated chaos for population modeling are
	            discussed.},
